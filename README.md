# StudyApp
Meant to aid the user in preventing distractions and manage their time more effectively, with a priority towards students. 
* Organized the userâ€™s time for studying by managing their schedule and by potentially disabling notifications and messages. 
* Could send automated messages to those trying to contact the user to inform them that they were studying or busy.
